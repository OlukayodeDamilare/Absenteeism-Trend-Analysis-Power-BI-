## Absenteeism-Trend-Analysis

# Executive Summary

Employee absenteeism has a direct impact on productivity, workforce planning, and operational efficiency. This project analyzes absenteeism patterns across demographics, time periods, and absence reasons to help organizations understand who is absent, why absences occur, and when they are most frequent, enabling data-driven workforce decisions.

---

# Business Context

Organizations need visibility into absenteeism trends to reduce productivity losses and improve employee well-being. By analyzing historical absenteeism data, HR teams can identify risk patterns, design preventive policies, and allocate resources more effectively.

This project simulates a real-world HR analytics scenario using Power BI to transform raw attendance data into actionable insights.

# Objectives

The goals of this analysis are to
- Monitor overall absenteeism levels and trends
- Identify key drivers of employee absenteeism
- Analyze absenteeism across demographic groups
- Detect seasonal and monthly absence patterns
- Support proactive workforce and HR decision-making

---

# Key Business Questions
- How many employees are absent and for how long?
- Which age groups experience the highest absenteeism?
- What are the primary reasons for employee absence?
- How does absenteeism vary by season and month?
- Are absenteeism patterns influenced by BMI or education level?

---

# Dataset Overview

----

# Data Preparation & Modeling
- Cleaned and validated raw absenteeism data using Power Query
- Standardized categorical fields (age groups, BMI, education level)
- Created calculated measures to track absenteeism counts and trends
- Built relationships to support accurate filtering and analysis

---

# Key Metrics
- Total Employees = 36
- Total Absent Hours = 4,484
- Absenteeism Cases = 639
- Monthly & Seasonal Absenteeism Trends

---

# Key Insights
- Employees aged 27–36 recorded the highest number of absenteeism cases
- Medical reasons account for the majority of absences
- Absenteeism peaks during specific months, indicating seasonal patterns
- BMI categories show varying absenteeism distributions
- Employees with lower education levels recorded higher absenteeism cases

# Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides:
	•	High-level KPIs for quick monitoring
	•	Demographic breakdowns (age, BMI, education)
	•	Absence reason analysis
	•	Monthly and seasonal trend analysis
	•	Interactive filters for deeper exploration

# Recommendations
- Preventive Health Initiatives: Address medical-related absenteeism through wellness programs
- Targeted HR Interventions: Focus on high-absence age groups with flexible policies
- Seasonal Workforce Planning: Prepare staffing strategies for high-absence periods
- Policy Review: Investigate recurring absence reasons to reduce preventable cases
- Continuous Monitoring: Use the dashboard to track absenteeism trends over time

---

# Assumptions & Limitations
- Dataset is simulated and may not reflect real organizational data
- Absenteeism reasons are self-reported
- No direct link to productivity or performance metrics
- External factors (economic, personal, environmental) are not included

---

# Future Improvements

With additional data, this analysis could be extended by:
	•	Linking absenteeism to productivity and performance metrics
	•	Incorporating job roles and department-level analysis
	•	Tracking absenteeism trends longitudinally
	•	Applying predictive analytics to identify absenteeism risk
